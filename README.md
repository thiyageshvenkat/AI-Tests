You can't "solve for x" in the expression 2x + 4 + 67 because it's not an equation.  It's just an expression.

To solve for x, you need an equation, which means there's an equals sign (=) involved. For example:

* **2x + 4 + 67 = 0**
* **2x + 4 + 67 = 100**

**Here's how you'd solve for x in an equation:**

1. **Combine like terms:** 2x + 71 = 0 (or 2x + 71 = 100)
2. **Isolate the x term:** Subtract 71 from both sides: 2x = -71 (or 2x = 29)
3. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 2: x = -35.5 (or x = 14.5)
